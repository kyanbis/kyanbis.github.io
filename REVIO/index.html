<b>1. Dataset Description </b>
<br> 
<p style=text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;> 
Our dataset is based on the OCTA technique, by using the SS-OCT system to obtain the eye images of 50 people of different age groups. 
All optic disc and macula images are annotated by experienced doctors. To protect the privacy of people, 
the information of optic disc and macula images is anonymous during the construction of the optic disc and macula dataset.


According to the characteristics of OCTA images, we can examine the choroidal vessels on the basis of OCTA images.
The choroidal vessels are not easily distinguished due to the presence of complex structures in the ocular tissue features.
The optic disc and macula are usually located in the plane of the retinal nerve fiber layer with an inner boundary membrane covering the surface.
Therefore, we could determine the boundaries between the retinal nerve fiber layer and the anterior sieve plate area, the sieve plate area, and the posterior go of the sieve plate.
However, in our study, the areas of optic disc and macular lesions often appeared in the retinal nerve fiber layer. To clearly segment the optic disc and macular lesions, the
we chose the retinal nerve fiber layer and the sieve plate area to segment the optic disc and macular lesion.
<br>  This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software. 


    The data-set is captured by wide-field OCTA(WF-OCTA). The optic disc and macula dataset contains pixel-level labels and image-level labels of 288 $\times$ 288 pixels. 
<br>  This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software.

	Figure  shows the detailed schematic diagram of SS‚ÄêOCT system. The light from the swept light source passes through the beam splitter and enters reference and sample arms, respectively. 
The light power from the swept source was split 90% into the sample arm and 10% into the reference arm by a fiber coupler. In the sample arm, the light from swept source component reaches 
retina through a fiber coupler and collimation lens. In the reference arm, the light passes through a collimator and a focusing lens and a mirror reflects the light beam. 
The light from the reference and sample arms generates interference in a fiber coupler with a ratio of 50:50, and then was redirected toward a balance detector. 
Electronic signals from the detector were input into the computer.

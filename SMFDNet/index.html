<b>1. Dataset Description </b>
<br> 
<p style=text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;> 
Our dataset is based on the OCTA technique, by using the SS-OCT system to obtain the eye images of 50 people of different age groups. 
All retinal vessel images are annotated by experienced doctors. To protect the privacy of people, 
the information of retinal vessel images is anonymous during the construction of the optic disc and macula dataset.


According to the characteristics of OCTA images, we can examine the choroidal vessels on the basis of OCTA images.
<br>  This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software. 


    The data-set is captured by wide-field OCTA(WF-OCTA). The optic disc and macula dataset contains pixel-level labels and image-level labels of 288 Ã— 288 pixels. 
<br>  This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software.
